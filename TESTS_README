These are Evyatar's tests from Google Drive, adapted to be run directly via JUnit (in IntelliJ) rather than Python.
This will allow you to debug your program more easily, as well as use IntelliJ's built in diffing tool while debugging
errors.

These should work on both Windows and Linux(haven't tested on Mac, I assume it should work there too).
Note that 4 tests were disabled for non-Windows OS (they use a windows only hidden attribute) - in that case, you'll get
a special failing test indicating so. (It doesn't mean an error on your code, it only serves as a remainder to run the
tests on Windows too)

== Installation ==
These assume you're using IntelliJ.

Drop all included files into your project's test directory, so it should look like this:

evyatar_tester/
tests/
src/
src/filesprocessing/DirectoryProcessor.java     - this file must exist, and this class MUST BE PUBLIC, the 'main' method
                                                  MUST BE PUBLIC as well.

Then, you'll need to configure 'tests' as a test directory, do so as follows:

File -> Project Structure -> Modules
under the 'Sources' tab, you should see your project's file tree. Right click 'tests' and choose 'tests'
Now, the tests icon should become green.

Moreover, you'll need to install 2 libraries for JUnit 5, do as follows:
File -> Project Structure -> Libraries > + > From Maven
paste the following:
org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.4.2
then press "OK"

then, repeat the same, using the following:
org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-params:5.4.2


Now, everything should be ready to work

== Running ==
Right click 'tests' and click "Run 'all tests'".
